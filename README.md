# Gannett Tech Assessment

Created a UI that has a simple box that is draggable and another static simple box.

Every time the draggable box hits or overlaps the static box, the static box updates a text field within itself with the current timestamp.

## Running Locally

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mjparangot/gannett-assessment.git
cd gannett-assessment
npm install
npm start
```

The app should be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
